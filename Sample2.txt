What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with team members, and manage software development efficiently. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overriding each other's work.

Why Use Git?
Tracks Changes – Keeps a record of every modification made to a project.
Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project.
Branching & Merging – Allows working on different features without affecting the main project.
Backup & Recovery – Provides the ability to restore previous versions if needed.
Distributed System – Every developer has a complete copy of the project.
