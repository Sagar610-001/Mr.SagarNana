What is Git and GitHub?
ðŸ”¹ Git:
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain different versions of their projects. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts and provides features like branching, merging, and rollback.

ðŸ”¹ GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It provides a remote repository hosting service where developers can store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories. GitHub offers additional features like pull requests, issue tracking, CI/CD integration, and project management tools, making team collaboration seamless.
